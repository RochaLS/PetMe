PetMe! is your new pet companion app, add and keep track of useful information about your pet's well-being and the best part is that all this information can be shared with your family, friends, or the person who you live with.

# Why I created this app

I love having pets. I myself have two amazing dogs and two very cute cats and I used to live with my family. So I thought it was a little bit hard to organize all my pet's information in one place. And I thought it would be very nice to be able to share and control all this information together with my family. Then I decided to build this app to facilitate the sharing of important pet-related information between members of the same household.

## Front End

For this app, I decided to follow the MVC design pattern recommended by Apple, and it was the one I was already comfortable with. It's a very simple pattern and it helped me to organize my app's files and assets.

## Database and Storage

This app uses Firestore and Firebase Storage to store all it's related data and images. I found that Firebase was very easy and simple to work with, retrieving and sending data is very straight forward.

## Back End

To send users notifications that new pet-related data was added to the app, I used Firebase Cloud Functions to listen to the Firestore data, and then if something is triggered I'm using Firebase Cloud Messaging to send the user a real-time notification. I'm using Cloud Functions to trigger changes in the database when needed.
